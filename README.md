![alt tag](https://github.com/j3lackfire/JunctionJam/blob/master/Capture.PNG)

- Name: Mad Cubes.

- Theme: Resurrection (Given at site).

- Goal and objectives: You have to defend the green cargo to reach the objectives while the evil minions try to attack and destroy the cube. 

- Specialities: Upon dying and ressurected, your hero will be revived and ativate his special skill. It is the only way to win because the enemy will be a lot. So you quite need to die a lot to win. But you can't die too much since the creep will just attack the cargo instead of you, which in turn a game over.

- Control: Left click to select cube, right click to oder cube to move or attack.

- Date: 25-27 november 2016.
